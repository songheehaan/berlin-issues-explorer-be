# Setup development environment

First, if you don't already have it - create github account at [github](https://github.com) to be able to contribute to the project.

## Setup IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
  
For developing java projects it is very helpful to have IDE setup. You can either **setup IDE locally** or use **cloud IDE** which you can access from your browser. 

In case that you are not developing in java in general and want to have a quick look into the project, cloud IDE would be suitable as you can have it up and running quickly.
If, however, you want to be more involved in java ecosystem, it would be good that you go through installation process and have your local environment set up.

#### Run and build project locally

#### installation 

  * install java8 ([link](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html))
  * install gradle build tool ([link](https://gradle.org/install/))
  * install git ([link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
  * install/upgrade your favorite IDE ([intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installing-and-launching.html)/[eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/))
  
#### setup your fork of the project   
  * fork the project by clicking on "**Fork**" button in the upper right corner of the project [github page](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/berlin-issues-explorer-be)
  * clone your fork of the project through command line 
    * once you clicked on "**Fork**" button, you are led to your fork of the project (listed in your list of repositories within your github account). 
    
      There, in upper right corner there is a "**Clone or download**" button which if you click you see url to use when cloning
    * type in terminal, at the place where you want project to be stored 
    
      `git clone <URL from previous step>` 
    
      it will look like:
    
      `git clone https://github.com/<your user name>/berlin-issues-explorer-be.git`

#### build and run project locally   
  * open project (directory) you have just cloned in your IDE. Build it and run from terminal (being positioned inside project directory) with:  
  
    `gradle build && java -jar build/libs/berlin-issues-explorer-be-0.1.0.jar`


## Alternatively, use cloud IDE

There are many cloud IDEs, but only few flexible enough and still not requiring credit card for registration. We chose *cloudtasty* but we are open for suggestions:)

  * create free account at [codetasty](https://codetasty.com/)
  * send your username to berlinhacknights@womenwhocode.com, so that we add you to the project
  * once you get confirmation that you are added to the project, use `wwc-issues-explorer` workspace. All prerequisites are installed (java8, gradle build tool, git).
  * detailed information how to use cloud IDE and run the project there for the first time can be found [here](cloud_ide_setup.pdf)
